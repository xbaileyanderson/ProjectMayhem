Multiplayer GUI Game
This is a turn based combat game. The object of the game is to use moves to get your opponent's health down to 0. Each player must choose a class at the beginning of the game, which are based on the different colleges at Chapman University. The class selected determines two special moves for the player to use.

To run:

Step 1: Compile and run GameServer.java
Step 2: Open two other terminals and in each of them compile and run Player.java.
Step 3: Two GUI windows should open. These control the players. To look at the Players' healths, look at the GameServer console.
Step 4: Select your college by pressing one of the college buttons. Do this for both Players.
Step 5: On the first Player, choose a move.
Step 6: On the second Player, choose a move.
Step 7: keep alternating choosing moves until a winner is declared.
